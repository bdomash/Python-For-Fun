# Python-For-Fun
A couple of rather simple programs I wrote in python for fun.

The programs I have uploaded include:
-A GPA calculator, which allows you to put in whatever grades you want to test for each class, and computes my semester and cumulative GPA
-A simple battleship game
-A simulation of the card game war
-An overnight stock change calculator, showing the overnight changes in a few stocks/indices that I was interested in at the time
