# Python-For-Fun
A couple of rather simple programs I wrote in python for fun.

The programs I have uploaded include:

-A GPA calculator, which allows you to put in whatever grades you want to test for each class, and computes my semester and cumulative GPA

-A simple two-player battleship game.

-A simulation of the card game war. I created this because I was interested in simulating the winning percentage based on how many aces a player starts with. I also used this program to make some graphics in R based on the ebs and flows of a War game.

-An overnight stock change calculator, showing the overnight changes in a few stocks/indices that I was interested in at the time
